<p>
As known by many, we, humans are making the first steps towards Mars research and inhabitance 
with NASA starting the "Moon to Mars" project, it is estimated the takeoff will begin in 2024 using the Moon 
as a "launchpad" the reason for this? Well, the Moon has little atmosphere leading to a better climate to 
take off as there is no pressure resistance making weight little of an issue, through this vast more amounts 
of fuel can be stored by the rocket. What does this mean for us? well not that much really, It most likely won't 
be for anouther 40-80 years that Mars could be considered "liveable", and for such non-professional scope, the offer 
may not appear ever as the security risks are tremendous.

<p>
With every satellite orbiting earth is a reason for concern to Space Travel, currently, there are an estimated 
over 400,000 debris travelling in our orbit, with the current amount we estimate the chance of collision with 
one of these objects at 0.08% and rising! Counteracting that, 0.08% is still quite low with only 1 in 1,250 
failures and not all collisions with debris would be considered fatal.
